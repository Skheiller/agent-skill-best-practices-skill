# Common Skill Anti-Patterns

- Over-broad descriptions that trigger everywhere.
- Giant SKILL bodies with no references.
- Vague “best effort” instructions without ordered execution.
- Missing output contract (no clear deliverable format).
- Hidden platform assumptions.
- Unbounded command execution suggestions.
- Dead sections and TODO placeholders in production skills.
